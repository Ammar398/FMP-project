    <h1>EBAY DROPSHIPING</h1> <br>
    <p>Think of dropshipping, and eBay might not be the first thing that springs to mind. <br> <br>

      You're more likely to consider selling on Amazon, or better still, starting your own Shopify store for
      dropshipping. And that makes sense because these are where the really big bucks are. <br> <br>

      But despite its lower profile (and despite a somewhat rocky history with dropshipping), eBay
      dropshipping still has lots going for it. The best way to think of it is as a gateway to life as an
      e-commerce entrepreneur. You may not get a 6 figure lifestyle dropshipping on eBay, but 4 or 5 figures
      is definitely possible. <br> <br>

      And, compared to selling on Amazon or starting your own e-commerce store, eBay offers some advantages in
      terms of simplicity and cost. <br> <br>

      So, let's take a look at everything you need to know about eBay dropshipping: <br> <br>

      1)Is it really dead? <br>
      2)What are eBay's dropshipping policies? <br>
      3)How much does it cost? <br>
      4)Is it profitable and what are the drawbacks? <br>
      5)And what are the tips for success as an eBay dropshipper?<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Is eBay dropshipping dead? </h2>
    <p>
      There were certainly a lot of talks a couple of years ago about dropshipping on eBay being dead. The
      reality, however, is a bit more complicated. <br><br>

      <b>“Dropshipping” on eBay is not all it seems</b> <br> <br>
      Back in the mid-2010s, a lot of so-called “dropshippers” started doing something pretty unfair: <br> <br>

      They found products on retail sites like Amazon and Walmart. <br> <br>
      They advertised these products on their eBay store, just at a higher price.<br> <br>
      When a customer purchased from them, they ordered the product to be delivered to the customer from Amazon or
      Walmart and pocketed the difference in price.<br> <br>
      eBay customers were even receiving their products in Amazon branded boxes sometimes, with receipts showing
      the real amount the “dropshipper” had paid.<br> <br> <br>


      Unsurprisingly, the customers were unhappy. And so was eBay. Their brand was being damaged. <br> <br>

      <b> eBay says enough is enough</b> <br> <br>
      So, a couple of years ago, eBay drastically changed its rules for what dropshippers on eBay were allowed to
      do. <br> <br>

      This is when lots of articles and videos popped up saying “Dropshipping on eBay is dead.” <br> <br> <br>


      In reality, this couldn't be further from the truth. <br> <br>

      That's because what was going on before was not genuine dropshipping. It was pretty much a scam. <br> <br>

      <b>eBay is very much alive for real dropshippers</b><br> <br>
      For real dropshippers, eBay is still a good place to be. It sees huge volumes of commerce going through its
      marketplace. In the last 3 months of 2019, goods worth $22 billion were bought and sold on eBay. <br> <br>


      This is a market that's simply too big to miss out on. Sure, the long-term growth potential is smaller than
      on other marketplaces. But on the other hand, eBay is pretty straightforward to get started on and it's low
      risk. <br> <br>

      You can make a decent living dropshipping on eBay for sure. There are just a few things you'll need to
      understand, starting with eBay's dropshipping policy. <br> <br>
    </p>
    <h2> What's allowed to dropship on eBay?</h2>
    <p>
      Having been stung by so-called “dropshippers” before, eBay put in place some pretty detailed policies. So,
      if you want to give dropshipping on eBay a try, you'll need to understand this stuff first. <br> <br>

      Let's break down 3 key points from eBay's policies that relate to dropshipping.<br> <br>

      <b>1. eBay policy for dropshippers: buying from wholesalers</b><br> <br>
      The first key point is that you can only dropship from wholesalers. This has clearly been put in place in
      response to the scams that had been happening on eBay. <br> <br>

      As a dropshipper, you're only allowed to purchase your products from wholesalers, or, of course, directly
      from suppliers. This point is clearly emphasized in eBay's dropshipping policy, which states:<br> <br>

      “listing an item on eBay and then purchasing the item from another retailer or marketplace that ships
      directly to your customer is not allowed on eBay.”<br> <br>

      But you can still dropship if you are getting your products from a wholesaler or supplier. <br> <br>

      So, if you're thinking about getting started as a dropshipper on eBay, remember that you'll have to source
      the products from a wholesaler or supplier. If you're new to this, check out this list of 24 great suppliers
      and wholesalers for dropshippers. Sourcing your products from any of these would comply with eBay's
      policy.<br> <br>


      <b>2. eBay policy for dropshippers: guaranteeing delivery time</b> <br> <br>
      The second key point is that you have to be able to guarantee delivery within 30 days. This applies to all
      sellers, not just dropshippers.<br> <br>

      This timeframe is pretty standard, and to be honest your customers will also be expecting delivery within
      this timeframe, if not faster.<br> <br>

      Just bear this point in mind when you're finding suppliers. You should mention this explicitly, and also
      check out their track record by reading reviews. Late delivery will mean not only angry customers, but it
      could mean a fine from eBay too, or the loss of your Top Rated seller status.<br> <br>

      <b>3. eBay policy for dropshippers: responsibility for delivery</b> <br><br>
      According to eBay's policies, you are responsible when things go wrong with the delivery or product. Here's
      what the policy says: <br> <br>

      If you use drop shipping, you're still responsible for the safe delivery of the item within the timeframe
      stated in your listing for the buyer's overall satisfaction with their purchase.<br> <br>

      There are 2 key terms to understand here:<br> <br>

      1. “Safe delivery of the item within the timeframe stated.” This means it's your job is to ensure the item
      is delivered (all in one piece) to the customer by the date you promised. This can be a challenge as a
      dropshipper because you are not the one actually doing the delivery. So, be sure to find out how quickly
      your supplier can process orders and which delivery provider they use. <br> <br>

      2. “The buyer's overall satisfaction with their purchase.” This basically means, is the customer happy with
      the product they receive? Does it match the description and images you provide on eBay? And does the quality
      match their expectations? <br> <br>

      Here, you have some responsibility. Make sure that the descriptions and images on your product listing are
      accurate. The best way to do this is to order a sample from your supplier and do the product description and
      photos yourself. Then there is the question of defective goods. You'll need to be able to provide a
      replacement or refund, so make sure you have negotiated this with your supplier. <br> <br>

      Overall, both of these points emphasize the importance of finding a reliable supplier. Prioritizing cost
      over quality and reliability could get you into a lot of hot water. <br> <br>


      <b>4. eBay policy for dropshippers: the consequences</b><br><br>
      If you don't meet these requirements for dropshipping on eBay you could be hit with one of these
      punishments:<br><br>

      1)A lower seller rating. This will make it harder to attract new customers.<br>
      2)Restrictions on buying. You might be banned from selling certain products.<br>
      3)Loss of buyer protections. This means eBay will no longer back you up if you get into a dispute with a
      customer.<br>
      4)Account suspension. In this case, you won't be able to sell on eBay while your account is suspended. <br>
      So, make sure you fully understand eBay's dropshipping policy before you get started. And, even more
      importantly, take your time to find a good supplier who can ensure you meet all of these
      requirements.<br><br>
    </p>


    <h2>How much does it cost to dropship on eBay?</h2>
    <p>
      There is a simple answer to this question, which is: not much. At least, it is definitely cheaper than
      selling on Amazon in terms of fees. <br><br>

      And, because you get up to 200 listings for free, it is possible to get started dropshipping on eBay for
      virtually nothing. You can get a rough idea of how much it will all cost using eBay's fee calculator.
      <br><br>

      So that's the simple answer. <br><br>

      For a more comprehensive answer to the question of how much it costs to dropship on eBay, we need to
      understand the eBay seller fees properly. <br><br>

      For most product niches, you'll be paying 2 basic fees to eBay. <br><br>

      First, you pay an insertion fee. This is a charge for putting your listing up on eBay. <br><br>
      Then you pay a final value fee when you make a sale. eBay takes a percentage of the total value of the sale,
      including shipping costs. <br><br>
      Let's go into a bit more detail on these fees. <br><br>

      <b>eBay insertion fees - how much will I pay?</b><br><br>
      As we've already mentioned, you get up to 200 free listings on eBay every month (or 250 if you use eBay's
      Manager Payments service). So, if you stay within this amount, you won't have to pay anything. <br><br>

      Once you have used up your free listings, you then pay $0.35 per listing. And that's pretty much it, just
      remember these points.<br><br>

      1)This is a fee for creating the listing. So, even if your item doesn't sell, you won't get the fee
      back.<br><br>
      2)If you list the same item in two or more different categories, you pay the insertion fee for each category
      your item is in.<br><br>
      3)You pay the insertion fee every time you relist an item.<br><br>
      <b>eBay final value fees - how much will I pay?</b><br><br>
      The amount you'll pay in final value fees as a dropshipper depends on the type of product you are selling.
      Let's take a look at the fees that will apply to most dropshippers, then look at one exception.<br><br>

      <b>eBay final value fees for most dropshipped products</b> <br> <br>
      Most products that are dropshipped - including top trending products in 2021 like yoga mats, wireless
      charging stations, and dog jackets - fall under eBay's fee structure for “most products.” <br> <br>

      For these products, the following fees apply: <br> <br>

      1) A $0.35 insertion fee<br> <br>
      2) A 10% final value fee. This means eBay will take a 10% cut of the total value of the product you sell,
      including shipping. So, let's say you dropship a yoga mat for $40, and shipping is an additional $5. In this
      case, you're going to pay eBay $4.50. <br> <br>
      There is a cap on the total final value fee you have to pay, but it is set at $750 for these products. The
      product and shipping would need to have a value exceeding $7,500 for this cap to apply, so it's not going to
      be relevant for most dropshippers on eBay.<br> <br>

      <b>eBay final value fees for athletic shoes</b> <br> <br>
      One product category that enjoys lower fees on eBay is athletic shoes. Clearly, this is a niche that eBay
      wants to encourage on its marketplace, so it has created some great conditions for dropshippers selling
      sneakers.<br> <br> These conditions include:<br> <br>

      1)zero insertion fee if the price is $100 or more,<br> <br>
      2)0% final value fee if the price is $100 or more. If the price is under $100, you pay 10% just like other
      product categories.<br> <br>


      There are a couple of other categories with different fee conditions, but it's highly unlikely you will be
      dropshipping bass guitars, commercial printing presses, books, or food trucks. If you are, you can check out
      a full breakdown of the fees here. <br> <br>

      <b>Other fees on eBay</b><br> <br>
      There are 2 other types of fees you'll need to factor in when you dropship on eBay. <br> <br>

      <b>eBay fees for payments</b><br> <br>
      First, you'll need to think about payment processing, eBay's managed payments scheme launched in 2018. As
      this announcement on managed payments explains, it becomes compulsory. Once you are on the managed payments
      scheme, the final value fee increases to 12.55% for most product categories. This basically covers the cost
      of Amazon handling your payments.<br> <br>

      On the other hand, with eBay managed payments you will no longer be paying fees to Paypal. <br> <br>

      <b>eBay fees for upgrading your listing</b>
      Second, you have the option to “upgrade” your listing in a couple of ways. <br> <br>

      You should also definitely consider upgrading at least some of your listings. As a new seller, it can be
      hard to get your products in front of shoppers. Once you have more traction, you can increase your
      profitability by cutting back on some of these upgrades. <br> <br>
      You can have the listing appear in bold on the page so it stands out. You can also add “Gallery Plus”, which
      lets users see a larger image during their search. <br> <br>


      With Gallery Plus, your product images enlarge when a shopper interacts with the listing. Image source: eBay
      But there are fees for these services. <br> <br>

      For auction-style selling, adding bold costs $2 per listing for items under $150 and $3 for items over $150.
      To add gallery plus, it costs $0.35 per listing for items under $150 and $0.70 for items over $150.
      For fixed price selling (eBay calls these “Good Til Cancelled Listings”), adding bold will cost you $4 per
      listing for items under $150 and $6 for items over $150. Meanwhile, the prices for adding gallery plus are
      $1 per listing for items under $150 and $2 for items over $150.
      There are other services available, such as setting a minimum price for your product - you can find details
      of all eBay listing services and their price in this article by eBay.<br> <br>

      <b>Is eBay dropshipping profitable, and what are the drawbacks?</b><br> <br>
      OK, we've had a look at the policies and fees for eBay dropshipping. What about the ultimate question - is
      it profitable?<br> <br>


      <b>Will you end up making enough money dropshipping on eBay?</b><br> <br>
      Let's take a look at some of the benefits of eBay dropshipping, then we'll consider some of the
      downsides.<br> <br>

      <b>The benefits of eBay dropshipping</b><br> <br>
      Let's look at 4 benefits of dropshipping on eBay, starting with the biggest.<br> <br>

      <b>1. Minimal investment required to start dropshipping </b><br> <br>
      By far the biggest benefit of eBay dropshipping is that you can start with virtually no investment. As we've
      seen, you get 200 or 250 free listings to kick you off. This means you'll only be paying eBay a fee when you
      actually sell something. <br> <br>

      So, compared to selling on Amazon or starting a Shopify store, eBay is cheaper in terms of start-up
      costs.<br> <br>

      <b>2.Low risk </b><br> <br>
      Because you are dropshipping, you're not going to be buying stock. And with minimal start-up costs for
      selling on eBay, there's really not much you can lose if your first dropshipping venture isn't a hit.<br>
      <br>

      <b>3. Simplicity </b><br> <br>
      You'll have to create a listing that is accurate and clear, and you should consider investing in upgrading
      some of your listings. <br> <br>

      But, once you've done these, there's not a huge deal else to consider at first. Again, in comparison to
      Amazon or Shopify, eBay wins in terms of simplicity.<br> <br>

      <b>4. Presence on a marketplace where $22 billion sold every quarter </b><br> <br>
      Finally, don't forget that millions of Americans are active on eBay every year, and they're spending
      literally billions of dollars. Capturing even a tiny fraction of those sales can be your springboard to
      e-commerce success.<br> <br>

      <b>The downsides of eBay dropshipping</b><br> <br>
      While getting started may be low risk and low cost, there are plenty of disadvantages to dropshipping on
      eBay too.<br> <br>
      <b>
        1. Very high competition </b><br> <br>
      Because the barriers to entry are so low, there's a lot of competition on eBay. <br> <br>

      There are an estimated 1.3 billion items listed on eBay. This means there's a good chance other sellers will
      be selling the same items as you. Worse still, if you're sourcing your product using dropshipper supplier
      software, others are probably dropshipping those exact same items on eBay already. <br> <br>

      All of which means you'll need to keep your prices very low, which can hit your profitability. Plus, there
      may be dirty tricks involved, with competitors buying your products then placing bad reviews or making
      returns, which will damage your listing place and make you harder to find. <br> <br>

      <b>2. They're eBay's customers, not yours</b> <br> <br>
      It's pretty hard to build brand loyalty on eBay (or Amazon for that matter). And loyalty is critical for
      profitability. Return customers are much more profitable than new ones, because there's a lower investment
      in marketing required. <br> <br>

      But how do you build a loyal customer base on eBay? With no option to get your logo on the box, customers
      won't associate the product with you, but with eBay. So you get no credit if it's a good experience, but you
      carry all the responsibility if it's a bad one. <br> <br>

      Finally, there is also the fact, according to research on eBay and Amazon, that eBay is less trusted by
      shoppers. Is this really a brand you want to be connected with?<br> <br>

      <b>3. Up to 10% of any sale goes to eBay</b><br> <br>
      After eBay's fees and the percentage taken by your dropshipping supplier, there's not going to be much left
      for you. This becomes especially problematic when you have to keep your prices low due to high
      competition.<br> <br>

      Tips for success in eBay dropshipping<br> <br>
      After weighing up the benefits and drawbacks, the best approach is to treat eBay as a testing ground for
      your dropshipping venture. You could use it to have your first try at dropshipping to see if you enjoy it.
      Or it could be a useful platform for trying out new products. <br> <br>

      For example, one smart strategy would be to trial products on eBay, and if they prove popular enough, switch
      them over to your Shopify store. In the long run, you're going to make a lot more profit and have a much
      better chance of building brand loyalty using Shopify.<br> <br>

      So, there's the tip for the overall strategy for eBay dropshipping. What about more specific pointers? Here
      are a few to try out.<br> <br>

      Take a course. As with all e-commerce activities, the more you learn the better you'll get. And you might
      avoid some costly mistakes early on. For example, you could try out this course from Dropshipping Titans
      focused on eBay dropshipping.<br> <br>
      Find the right software. Platforms like Oberlo only work for Shopify. So try Inventory Source. It has an
      integrated supplier network, and you can dropship items from suppliers on a range of platforms, including
      eBay. <br> <br>

    <h1>EBAY PRIVATELABEL</h1>
    <p>All musicians start out with a love for music. Then, as a novice, they learn how to play a song or two.
      Later,
      they land their first gig, and their lifetime success depends almost entirely on their drive to keep going,
      work
      harder, and learn what it takes to earn a place on the wall of fame. <br> <br>

      Likewise, eBay sellers start out as shoppers. Once they fall in love with the platform, they might list an old
      pair of shoes or the iPhone they're about to retire. When their first item sells, that's when the bug hits --
      some people create their own products, some shop thrift stores and liquidation sales for deals, and others
      move
      on to drop shipping. The next stage in their eBay success timeline usually involves the leap to private label
      sales. <br> <br>

      <b>Here's what you need to know to rock your strategy for private label on eBay.</b>
    </p>

    <h2> What is Private Label Retail?</h2>
    <p> Retailers like you can contract out product creation through a third-party and market it under your own
      brand;
      this is usually the next step in scaling your eBay sales after you have a handle on drop shipping processes.
      But, you can launch a private label product line at any time.<br> <br>

      Have you ever noticed restaurant-branded ketchup at your table when eating at a diner? Well, it's likely the
      company has a contract with a larger, more well-known company who actually bottles the product. Likely, the
      restaurant added its brand to the label and purchased it at a lower rate for dining use and resale.<br> <br>

      So, learn how to find manufacturers that can meet your demands and those of your customers. Make sure to
      detail
      exactly what you need before you start your search. Keep in mind that you may only be able to work with
      suppliers that offer lower minimum order quantities (MOQs) in the beginning. But, as you scale, more doors
      will
      open. <br> <br>
    </p>


    <h3> What Kind of Private Label Products are Available?</h3>
    <p>
      Private label products come in nearly every consumer product category known. For example, a pet store might
      add
      their brand name to dog leashes and collars from a trusted source. A hair salon might launch “their own line”
      of
      shampoos and conditioners when the products are actually manufactured by another company. <br> <br>

      This list includes:<br> <br>

      Motors<br>
      Fashion<br>
      Electronic<br>
      Home & Garden<br>
      Sporting Goods<br>
      Toys & Hobbies<br>
      Business & Industrial<br>
      Music<br><br>


      If your business falls under one of these categories, chances are you can find a product manufacturer willing
      to
      work out a private label contract with you. However, if you're in the arts and collectibles niche, that might
      be
      a little harder (but not impossible). As you can imagine, it's not really an artisan-style business
      option.<br><br> </p>

    <h3> Is Print on Demand the Same as Private Label?</h3>
    <p>
      Many eBay sellers have had success with print on demand. You might be wondering if this is the same as private
      label sales. Well, sort of.<br><br>

      Print on demand is the process of working with a printer to design books, t-shirts, coffee mugs, and other
      customizable products to order at any time.<br><br>



      print on demand ebay example
      Source: eBay
      It has the added benefit of having no need for on-hand inventory. So, with this business structure, you can
      focus on design and marketing. Additionally, you have the ability to experiment with and change your designs
      as
      much as you like.<br><br>

      Most private label situations won't offer the same level of freedom because you'll be working with an existing
      manufacturer who has its own set of processes in place. These manufacturers are flexing their process to serve
      you.<br><br> </p>

    <h3>What Are the Benefits of Private Label on eBay</h3>
    <p>
      You probably want to hear more about how private label can enhance your eBay business. After all, eBay is the
      new frontier for private label sellers.<br><br>
      <b>
        So, here are the key benefits:</b>

      Control Over Product Details<br>
      Control Over Product Pricing and Profits<br>
      Control Over Brand Identity<br>
      Ability to Deliver Large Orders<br>
      Ease Over Organizing Sales Processes<br><br>

      Your level of control over the product will vary since all private label situations will be customized as an
      arrangement between you and the manufacturer. In some cases, the only customization you will receive is your
      logo added to an existing product in the manufacturer's catalog.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h2> Common Private Label Pain Points to Watch for</h2>
    <p>
      Private label pain points can closely match those of custom manufacturing. But, the processes should run more
      smoothly when you work with the right companies. Here are three common problems you might come across with
      private label product retail:<br><br>

      Lack of Manufacturer Compliance<br>
      Poor Communication<br>
      Unsatisfactory Manufacturer Return Policies<br><br>

      I like to recommend that sellers always start with a test order. Make a smaller purchase from your
      manufacturer
      before you commit to selling private label products to your customers. And, even if nothing goes wrong, make a
      call to customer service to see how they handle communications.<br><br>

      Communication and flexibility are a must for this type of retail structure and it's your job to test the
      waters
      before you dive in. You don't want to be in over your head before it's too late to turn back -- that's how
      sellers drown.<br><br> </p>

    <h2>Private Label Best Practices to Implement</h2>
    <p>
      Part of the beauty of private label on eBay is that you get to leave a large portion of the work to the
      manufacturer. They create the product while you focus on marketing, sales, and customer service. This is how
      you
      can win at private label sales:<br><br>

      1. <b>Work with a brand that shares your core values.</b><br>
      As an eBay seller, what are your core values? You need to know what is important to you, the retailer, and
      your
      customers before you seek a manufacturer for your private label products. For example, if you're not going to
      be
      passionate about selling hair care products with sulfates and chemicals, find a manufacturer who creates
      organic
      shampoo bases.<br>


      Furthermore, this goes beyond product quality to your business processes. If you want to provide 100% customer
      satisfaction and allow free, no-questions-asked returns, make sure the company creating your products in
      on-board with that as well (or be willing to adjust your values and policies).<br><br>

      2. <b> Make your listings easy to find and give them aesthetic appeal.</b><br>
      Before the sale, customers find you through the eBay search bar. By now, you already know how to write a
      killer
      headline and optimize your product descriptions. But, it's time to take it a step further with custom listing
      design. Use the eBay Listing Designer to create stunning eBay listings that stand out from your
      competitors.<br>



      After the sale, you want to make sure your customers know what else you have to offer. So, make sure to follow
      up via email and let buyers know what other items you're selling on eBay. Utilize the PDF Catalog Creator to
      create a branded product catalog in just a few clicks.<br><br>


      3. <b>Build strong relationships with your manufacturers.</b> <br>
      As with all aspects of business, relationships are your bread and butter. One of the most valuable pieces of
      advice I can leave you with is to develop and maintain great relationships with your manufacturers, second
      only
      to your relationships with your customers. Your ability to do so will make or break your success. <br>

      Imagine that it's the holiday season and you have received more orders than you anticipated. But, you're not
      the
      only one. In fact, most of the private label brands that your manufacturer works with are in the same boat.
      So,
      which brands do you think will get first priority when they request to quadruple their order size in early
      December? <br>

      The brands with the best relationships are going to get first dibs on new product orders, regardless of annual
      sales volume. Why? It's human nature, pure and simple. So, don't forget to nurture your relationships
      throughout
      the year. <br> <br>

      <b>Final Thoughts</b><br>
      Follow the advice above to totally rock your private label sales. If you think you're ready, start today and
      watch those high volume eBay sales start to roll in.<br><br>

    <h1>FACEBOOK MARKETPLACE</h1>
    <p>Facebook Marketplace was introduced in 2016 as a place for people to buy and sell within their communities.
      Think Craigslist, but with Messenger. <br><br>

      But plans to incorporate more brands into the platform mean that big changes are underway. In June 2018,
      Facebook announced the option for businesses to place ads in Marketplace. And soon Facebook will add more B2C
      options to the C2C platform.<br><br>

      In other words, think Amazon with a hyper-targeting algorithm.<br><br>

      So, how does Facebook Marketplace work exactly? And what can businesses do to prepare? Read on to learn which
      features are currently available and how to plan for what's in store.<br><br>
    </p>


    <h3>What is Facebook Marketplace?</h3>
    <p>
      Facebook Marketplace is an online shopping channel. It's a place for Facebook users to buy and sell from each
      other locally.<br><br>

      As of May 2018, Marketplace is used in more than 70 different countries by more than 800 million people each
      month.<br><br>

      You can access Facebook Marketplace in the Facebook app and on desktop:<br><br>

      1)On mobile, click the white storefront symbol at the bottom of the app on iOS and at the top of the app on
      Android.<br><br>
      2)On a desktop web browser, click the red and white storefront symbol in the left margin.<br><br>
      Listings in Facebook Marketplace are organized by categories like Entertainment, Vehicles, Housing, and
      Hobbies.
      Shoppers can filter searches by price and location, and save listings for future reference.<br><br>

      Each listing can contain up to 10 photos along with a description of the product.<br><br>

      Interested customers can message sellers directly on Messenger to ask questions.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h3>What is Facebook Marketplace?</h3>
    <p>
      Ads in Facebook Marketplace appear in-feed when someone browses.<br><br>

      These placements have the advantage of reaching people where they are shopping. Advertisers have seen a marked
      increase in conversion rates compared with News Feed placements.<br><br>

    <h3>Facebook Marketplace Shop listings</h3>
    For now, only companies in the US can apply to list and sell products in Facebook Marketplace. Auto dealerships
    in certain locations are also allowed to list vehicles through inventory partners.<br><br>

    Brand listings currently appear in two areas on Marketplace: in the Shop category and in the Daily Deals
    category. (As of January 2019, this content is only visible to US users.) Only hand-selected businesses that
    offer brand-name products at discounted rates are eligible for the deals program.<br><br>

    Facebook doesn't charge list fees or take a cut of commissions. So for brands approved to list products,
    Marketplace is essentially a free, organic distribution channel. But Marketplace listings require a Facebook
    Checkout integration, which charges a $.30 and 2.9 percent fee for every transaction.<br><br>
    </p>

    <h3> The deals program</h3>
    <p>
      There are three tiers to the deals program: the Everyday Deal, the Featured
      Deal, and the Lighthouse Program.<br><br>

      Better deals are placed into higher tiers that offer higher exposure. For example, brands that offer exclusive
      deals in the Lighthouse Program may benefit from top placement, consumer subsidies, on and off-site marketing,
      and influencer outreach.<br><br>

      Ads and shop listings have the advantage of Facebook's targeting algorithm, which will surface your content to
      the most likely customers.<br><br></p>

    <h3>Who is eligible to sell on Facebook Marketplace?</h3>
    <p>
      Right now there are two primary avenues for businesses interested in selling on Marketplace.<br><br>

      You can either apply to list in the Facebook Marketplace Shop, or apply to be a deals partner. Remember,
      applications are currently only open to US merchants and automotive companies.<br><br></p>

    <h3> How to apply to list in the Facebook Marketplace Shop</h3>
    <p>
      To apply to sell on Facebook Marketplace, Page admins need to complete the Marketplace eCommerce Retailer
      Interest Form. Because access to Marketplace is limited, working with one of Facebook's listing partners, such
      as BigCommerce, Shopify, or Zentail is a definite advantage.<br><br>

      To apply, retailers must be able to meet these requirements:<br><br>

      1)Sell new products to consumers <br>
      2)Business based in the US <br>
      3)Orders must be fulfilled within three days and received within seven days <br>
      4)Accept returns up to 30 days <br>
      5)Product listings must include a name, description, additional product images, and a thumbnail image on a
      solid
      <br><br>
      Companies from the following industries have been prioritized to sell on Marketplace: beauty, apparel and
      accessories, bags and luggage, baby and kids, home décor.<br><br>
